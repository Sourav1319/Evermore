Evermore:

It is a website that is sprcifically built for the students in collges who are in need of some books or magazines, it acts as an interface of communication between seniors or juniors or various students in colleges establishing a sort of provider and consumer relationship.

Here studenst who have something can upload information about the object in the site, while those who are interested in buying or just using the products on a rental basis can contact the mentioned person.

This site is protected using authentication(as it is only availble for college students), which was achieved using passport.js.

Currently the site has these feature:

1)Students can create add there things they want to sell/rent on the homepage and provide his information with it.
2)If any student gets interested in buying or renting the products, he/she may directly ask the owner for further info in the comments.
3)If the item is sold out or not availbale on current basis, the owener can remove them form the page.
4)Students will also have the functionality to delete/edit their comments on the product page.

Things that i am working on right on:

1) Search functionality as right now, students have to browse the whole homepage to search for the require item.
2) Generating a user page for all the users so, they can quickly know what are the items that are on sale/rent from their side.
3) Cataloging the items availbale like done in coursera or amazon.com, to enable better user experience.
4) Payment facility but i think on a college level this feature will not be of much use as every student will first try to get a physical look at the item.
